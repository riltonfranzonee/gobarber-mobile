Barbershop system that connects clients and providers - Mobile application made with React Native

ðŸ’ˆ About GoBarber
------------------
This project is a system of a fictional barbershop called GoBarber. The full system has a [**web version**](https://github.com/riltonfranzonee/gobarber) made with ReactJS, an exclusive area for providers, where they are able to list all their appointments, change personal info and recieve notifications everytime a new appointment is created (also via email). The application also has a [**mobile version**](https://github.com/riltonfranzonee/gobarber-mobile) made with React Native, an exclusive area for clients, where they are able to create a new appointment with their favorite provider based on the available schedule. Besides that, the client is able to cancel the appointment (must be at most 2 hours before the appointment). All this system is served by a [**REST API**](https://github.com/riltonfranzonee/gobarber-api) made with Node.js

:wrench: Used technologies:
----------------------
The mobile version of the application handles with a lot of features such as data persistence, api calls and date picker. For the data persistence I found that Redux would be the best fit. I've also used other libraries and technologies to help me build this up, take a look at some of them: 

- [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev/)
- [**Redux**](https://redux.js.org/)
- [**Redux Saga**](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
- [**Styled Components**](https://styled-components.com/)
- [**React Native Vector Icons**](https://oblador.github.io/react-native-vector-icons/)
- [**Axios**](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [**Axios**](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [**date-fns**](https://date-fns.org/docs/Getting-Started)
- [**Eslint**](https://eslint.org/)
- [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/)
- [**EditorConfig**](https://editorconfig.org/)
